# Computer Systems In-Class Lab Exercises

## Exercise 1: System Hardware Detective (15-20 minutes)
**Format:** Solo or pairs  
**Objective:** Students will identify and analyze their computer's hardware components using built-in system tools.

### Instructions:
1. **Windows Users:** Open "System Information" (type `msinfo32` in Start menu)
   **Mac Users:** Hold Option key + Apple menu → "System Information"
   **Linux Users:** Open terminal and run `lscpu`, `lshw`, or `inxi -F`

2. **Find and record the following:**
   - Processor (CPU) brand, model, and number of cores
   - Total RAM amount and type (DDR4/DDR5)
   - Storage device type (HDD/SSD) and capacity
   - Operating System version

3. **Analysis Questions:**
   - Based on your CPU cores, how many tasks can your processor theoretically handle simultaneously?
   - Is your storage primarily HDD or SSD? What are the performance implications?
   - How does your RAM amount compare to typical requirements for modern applications?

### Deliverable:
Complete a simple system specification sheet and answer the analysis questions.

Processor (CPU) brand, model, and number of cores 

INTEL CORE I7 14 CORES

Total RAM amount and type (DDR4/DDR5) 

16 DDR5

Storage device type (HDD/SSD) and capacity 

SSD 512 GBS

Based on your CPU cores, how many tasks can your processor theoretically handle simultaneously?

14 tasks at once (one per core).

Is your storage primarily HDD or SSD? What are the performance implications?

My storage is only SSD that means that its performance it is better and have a longer durability

How does your RAM amount compare to typical requirements for modern applications?

I think that my RAM can work properly in almost all the applications, because it has the latest DDR5 technology and 16 are enough for all the programs that I have.

## Exercise 2: Operating System Feature Hunt (15-20 minutes)
**Format:** Solo or pairs  
**Objective:** Students will explore and identify key OS functions on their own devices.

### Mission:
Find real examples of the five key OS functions running on your computer right now.

### Tasks:

1. **Process Management:**
   - Open Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (Mac), or System Monitor (Linux)
   - Identify 5 currently running processes
   - Find one process using the most CPU

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Check total RAM usage
   - Find which application is using the most memory
   - Identify available free memory

3. **File System Management:**
   - Navigate to your Documents folder
   - Create a new folder called "OS_Lab_Test"
   - Check the folder's properties/info to see creation date

4. **Device Management:**
   - Access Device Manager (Windows) or System Report (Mac)
   - Identify 3 different types of hardware devices listed
   - Find one device driver that's currently installed

5. **Security Features:**
   - Check if Windows Defender/antivirus is running
   - Verify if automatic updates are enabled
   - Look for any recent security scans

### Challenge Questions:
- Which process is using the most resources and why might that be?
- What would happen if your OS didn't manage memory automatically?
- How does your OS protect you from security threats?

### Deliverable:
Complete a checklist of found features and answer the challenge questions.

Which process is using the most resources and why might that be?

The process using the most resources is Microsoft Edge, which is consuming around 1,094 MB of memory. This happens in general the web browsers need to open multiple tabs and processes

What would happen if your OS didn’t manage memory automatically?

If the operating system didn’t manage memory automatically would be imposible to know if the computer’s memory is working properly, for example this lack could cause applications to overwrite the memory of other apllications

How does your OS protect you from security threats?

The OS protects us from security threats for example controlling the permissions apps have or giving the user regular updates to fix new problems or irregularities.

## Lab Rubric

**Total Points: 2 marks**

## Requirements for Completion:
* **Exercise 1 (Required):** Complete system specification sheet with all hardware components identified AND answer all three analysis questions with thoughtful responses
* **Exercise 2 (Optional):** If attempted, complete feature checklist for all 5 OS functions AND answer challenge questions

## Lab Rubric:

| Criteria | Poor - 0 mark | Fair - 1 mark | Good - 2 marks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lab Completion | Missing system specification data OR analysis questions not attempted OR answers lack depth (single sentence, vague responses that don't address the questions) | Successfully identified most hardware components and completed system specification sheet, but analysis questions show minimal effort or understanding | Successfully completed full system specification sheet with accurate hardware identification AND provided thoughtful analysis answers that demonstrate understanding of hardware implications |
