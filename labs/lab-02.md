Developing a desktop application - Develop a simple calculator program for Windows/Mac.

I think that VS Code will be our IDE, because it is a good option, first it is a free code editor and supports multiple languages, also this program has auto-completion, error detection, themes, extensions and other multiple features that helps at the moment of programming.

Tools like linters would be very useful to improve the code and avoid bugs early, also the formatters are important to keep the code consistent and readable. However, installing Git for version control would be useful to track changes.

This calculator app is lightweight, so it doesn’t require high-performance hardware. A standard computer with:
At least 4 GB RAM
1.5 GHz or faster CPU
Around 500 MB of storage for Python and IDE installation will be more than enough. Any modern laptop (Windows, macOS, or Linux) can run this without issues.

Collaboration can be managed using GitHub or GitLab for version control and code sharing. For communication, Discord, Zoom, iMessage.

Estimated time: Installing Python and an IDE: 15–30 minutes
Setting up Git for version control: 15 minutes
Downloading dependencies: 0 minutes (Tkinter is included with Python)
